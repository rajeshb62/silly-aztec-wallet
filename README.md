Opinionated, experimental and silly. privacy supports this wallet.

## Features
- cooking

## Setup
Why?
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Run the local node: `aztec-sandbox`
4. Deploy contracts: `yarn deploy`

## Scripts
Why again?
- `yarn deploy-schnorr`: Deploy the contract in one way
- `yarn send-tx`: Deploy the contract in another way and interact with token contract
- `yarn test`: Run the test suite- dont do it unless you want to get confused

This is an experimental project for learning purposes.
